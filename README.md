Discord architecture
Discord functions on a central client-server structure. This proprietary service delivers communication via audio, video, and text, using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) for implementation. Discord can be accessed through a web interface and also offers dedicated apps compatible with a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac. Additionally, it supports mobile devices running on Android and iOS.
